# Reasoning
While I was helping out with a scoping review I was brainstorming ways to make the process faster. I figured I could probably make some sort of web scraper that gives me the information I need from articles at the click of a button. So I created this extension afterwards and it saved me from screening through an entire webpage for key info.
